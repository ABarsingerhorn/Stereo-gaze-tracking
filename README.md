# Stereo-gaze-tracking
high-speed stereo-eye tracking setup

Stereo-gaze tracking consists of eye tracking software for a stereo eyetracker (C#) and offline gaze reconstructions algorithms (Matlab)   which were developed at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour by Annemiek Barsingerhorn and Jeroen Goossens.

The stereo eyetracker software and the gaze reconstruction algorithms are described in the following paper, which also includes a description of the hardware:
